# Biomechanics-Analysis-Program-for-Volleyball-Performance

This MATLAB-based project analyzes knee angles during volleyball movements to provide insights for optimizing athletic performance and reducing injury risk.

## 👥 Team Project

This program was developed as part of a group collaboration. I contributed to:
- Designing and implementing the knee angle analysis algorithm
- Preprocessing movement data
- Visualizing joint angle trends across different movements

## ⚙️ Features

- Extracts joint coordinates from motion data
- Calculates knee flexion/extension angles
- Plots angle trajectories during volleyball actions (e.g., jump, landing, approach)
- Provides statistical output to aid in injury prevention assessment

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies

- MATLAB
- Signal processing techniques
- Biomechanical modeling principles

## 📁 Files Included

- `main_script.m`: Main script to run analysis
- `angle_calculation.m`: Function to compute knee angles
- `data/`: Sample data files (if allowed)
- `README.md`: Documentation

## 📈 Sample Output

(You can add a screenshot or graph here, once uploaded to GitHub)

## 📝 Notes

*Due to the collaborative nature of this project, only code and components I directly worked on are included.*
